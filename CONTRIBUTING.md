# Contributing
Thank you for showing interest in this project! We appreciate and encourage any and all contributions to the project, however, do keep in mind that it takes some time to get responses on issues and reviews on PRs. Before contributing, have a look at the [CODE of CONDUCT](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and try to comply by those guidelines.

If you are new to contributing to projects on github, this project follows a certain pattern of development and contributing - [github flow](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-flow). You could learn more about how to use Github on [Github Labs](https://lab.github.com/) and through the [Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/)

Please ensure all pull requests and contributions comply with the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).

## Setting up the project
First, [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to your own account. Then use `git clone <forked-repo-url>` to clone your forked repository down to your local machine (remember to get the URL for _your_ repository - the fork, not the original repository).
Use `git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>` to add the original repository as the upstream (this is helpful for keeping your fork up-to-date).

## Feedback, Bug Reports, Issues - How to open issues?
If you have any feedback, bug reports, feature request or ideas, feel free to [open an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) on the project's repository. We love issues! ;D
Please, try not to duplicate issues and always try to give enough context in the issues that you open.
